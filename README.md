- **Dynamic Pricing**: Configurable base rates, hourly rates, and daily maximums per vehicle category and location.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

This is a full-stack monorepo consisting of two main environments:

- [`/frontend`](./frontend): A modern, lightning-fast React application built with Vite.
- [`/backend`](./backend): A robust Express.js REST API powered by PostgreSQL (Supabase).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- A PostgreSQL database (Supabase recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Saini-Yogesh/ParkFlow.git
   cd ParkFlow
   ```

2. **Set up the Backend:**
   Navigate to the backend directory, install dependencies, and configure your environment.
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
   *See the [Backend README](./backend/README.md) for detailed database setup and environment variables.*

3. **Set up the Frontend:**
   Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies.
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```
   *See the [Frontend README](./frontend/README.md) for configuration details.*

4. **Run the Application Locally:**
   You can run both servers simultaneously using your preferred method, or run them in separate terminal windows:
   
   Terminal 1 (Backend):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   Terminal 2 (Frontend):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
